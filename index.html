      <h1>Welcome to Blizzlike</h1>
      <p>We are a small community, hosting a World of Warcraft Multi-Expansion Server. Our rates are 1x and we obviously try to make things as blizzlike as possible.
        The software in use is the latest version of CMaNGOS, 100% Open-Source and our goal is to automate server hosting in a way, that everything is always kept up-to-date.
        Our PTR Realm contains the latest changes. Each wednesday, the latest PTR changes are applied to the stable realm. The characters are synced from the stable to the PTR realm on a daily basis.
        Unlike to other projects, we don't strive for world domination and we don't offer any GM support.
        For many people, this might not be worth playing, especially for those who need alot of guidance. Just ask each other for help and in case you are in big trouble, be patient.</p>

      <p>This project mainly targets people who know what they're doing and those, who want to experience some of the good old days in a comfy and friendly environment.
        The whole concept is not about competitive-gameplay and we don't provide so called "fresh" servers over and over again. Be nice to each other, play with your friends, do what you ever wanted to do and enjoy your stay.</p>

        <h1>World of Warcraft: Vanilla</h1>
        <p><span class="quote">World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the Warcraft fantasy universe. World of Warcraft
            takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous Warcraft release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. The game was announced in 2001, and was released for
            the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">Wikipedia</a></span></p>
        <p>
          On the Blizzlike realms, we host the latest patch that existed for this expansion, which is 1.12.1. It was released in 26 September 2006.

      <h1>Multi-Expansion Hosting</h1>
      <p>
        On blizzlike we provide a Vanilla (1.12.1), a TBC (2.4.3) and a WotLK (3.3.5a) realm. The player can decide where to play without the need of switching the server or get to know a new community. But the biggest advantage is, that a player is
        free to transfer the character to any later expansion by his own decission. Each character can be moved on its own and it is not required to turn the entire account into the next expansion.
      </p>
      <p>So if you're new here, you might want to consider starting your character on the Vanilla realm first. You will always be able to transfer to any later expansion as soon as you think you are ready for it.
        You can always move your characters upwards an expansion, but you will never be able to move back in time.</p>

            release day alone and making it, at the time, the fastest-selling PC game released at that point.[2] Approximately 3.53 million copies were sold in the first month of release, including 1.9 million in North America, over 100,000 copies

      <h1>100% Open Source</h1>
      <p>
        On our servers, we rely on Linux as operating system and using CMaNGOS (Continued Massive Network Game Object Server) as World of Warcraft server software.
      </p>
      <p>
        CMaNGOS is first and foremost an educational project. It is 100% open source. Its first goal is to learn how a game server works.
        The second goal to make every attempt to emulate the original World of Warcraft experience in a local environment. Their developers work on their free time and they all work as volunteers.</p>
      <p>
        If you haven't heard of it, you should really check out their github page: <a href="https://github.com/cmangos">CMaNGOS GitHub</a>.

            Northrend, home of the eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. In order to advance through Northrend, players are required to reach at least level 68 and the level cap for the expansion is 80. The first hero class was introduced,
            the

      <h1>Legacy Matters!</h1>
      <p>
        We believe the old expansions were huge milestones in computer gaming history and the numbers did prove it by repeatedly peaking the player numbers, for new MMO world records.
        By that, we put the game into the same category as pong, pacman, doom and alike. In our opinion, those games have to be preserved and archived for later generations in a way as they were at those glory times.
        This includes the gameclient with all its bugs and quirks, but also with the possibility to run the same addons as they did in those years.
        We believe that all this should be done 100% opensource as an effort to maintain the educational use, aswell as the historical value of the game we love.

      <h1>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Why only those 3 Expansions?</b><br />
        Those are our favorites and we know it is very subjective. We believe the best expansions were those, that were made before the effects of <a
          href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vivendi-and-activision-complete-transaction-create-activision?releaseid=320652">Activisions takeover</a> became noticeable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Why are all expansions on the latest Patch?</b><br />
        Most of our players are friends who want to experience the content together.
        It doesn't matter if ICC25 is opened or not, as they can decide on their own if they want to go for Naxxramas first or skipping it.
        We don't have "Firstkills" or anything that introduces any competitive gameplay. We strive for a long lasting project - no matter how active - that doesn't has to reset their databases for "fresh" all the time.
        If you seek for one of those, there are plenty and you better not start playing here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>So this is stock-core? Doesn't it have bugs?</b><br />
        Sure, and you should expect those. However, it is playable in general. But it is also in everyones duty - who loves those expansions as we do - to fix those, or at least to support
        those who fix them, in order to make it happen as 100% free code, that will last forever. The goal is to persist code, no matter of the company or the project that is hosting it right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How do you plan to make money with this?</b><br />
        We don't. We pay this project on our own, because a simple hosting is not as expensive as everyone ever thinks it is. We will never introduce any sort of Cash-Shop.
        We might ask for donations someday, but right now, everything is just fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Which Gameclient do I need?</b><br />
        The official gameclient from back in the days are required. It doesn't matter where you get them from, just make sure to obtain a clean gameclient without any modifications.
      <ul>
        <li>For <b>Vanilla</b> you need the <b>1.12.1</b> version, released in 2006</li>
        <li>For <b>TBC</b> you need the <b>2.4.3</b> version, releaed in 2008</li>
        <li>For <b>WotLK</b> you need the <b>3.3.5a</b> version, released in 2010</li>
      </ul>
      The new remade - so called "classic" - gameclients recently provided by Activision-Blizzard will not work. Those are current retail clients, modified to look like old version, but are incompatible to the old ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>So you really have no GMs?</b><br />
        Actually, we do. Atleast we have some GM-Accounts in order to help out if anyone encounters a situation in which nobody else could help him.
        But usually, 99% of the Problems can be solved by the community itself or by just using the hearthstone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Do you have any custom changes?</b><br />
        No, our goal is to emulate the project in a blizzlike way. Everything that is not as it used to be in the specific patch version is treated as bug.
        If we need to apply patches that differ from upstream CMaNGOS, we will make them publicy available in a special "patches" section on the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Don't you think the project will be dead on arrival?</b><br />
        We do, but we don't care. A group of 5 friends can do all kind of dungeons on their own, and they won't need an overcrowded environment for that.
        If you connect with other groups, you can even do raids. Sure, it's a different type of gameplay and might not be for you - and that's fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Am I allowed to multibox?</b><br />
        Sure, play however you like to play. Just make sure to not be a retard, don't break the game for others and avoid annoying other people with your playstyle.
